## Notes

Some challenges I encountered while constructing the website was getting items to display on the page with the JavaScript, but after iterating and testing new methods, 
I was able to get it to work. Another issue I encountered was experimenting with Flexbox in CSS because at first it was not displaying in the format 
I wanted it to, so tweaking the different Flexbox features and values helped me obtain my desired results.
